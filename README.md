## üôå Abstract
Fine-tuning Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in multi-task learning scenarios has emerged as an effective strategy for achieving cross-domain specialization. However, multi-task fine-tuning frequently induces performance degradation on open-response datasets. We posit that free-form answer generation primarily depends on language priors, and strengthening the integration of visual behavioral cues is critical for enhancing prediction robustness. In this work, we propose Noise Resilient Confidence Alignment to address the challenge of open-response overfitting during multi-task fine-tuning. Our approach prioritizes maintaining consistent prediction patterns in MLLMs across varying visual input qualities. To achieve this, we employ Gaussian perturbations to synthesize distorted visual inputs and enforce token prediction confidence alignment towards the normal visual branch. By explicitly linking confidence calibration to visual robustness, this method reduces over-reliance on language priors. We conduct extensive empirical evaluations across diverse multi-task downstream settings via popular MLLM architectures. The comprehensive experiment demonstrates the effectiveness of our method, showcasing its ability to alleviate open-response overfitting while maintaining satisfying multi-task fine-tuning performance.
